Luminosity-Radius Plot
===

This is a likely out-of-date version of the luminosity-radius diagram for all
sorts of Local Volume-ish objects. This is meant to be overly-inclusive, at the
risk of being imprecise. `lum_radius06.png` is likely to be the most "canonical"
version, though it does not yet include the DES dwarfs.
